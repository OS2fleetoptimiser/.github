# Welcome to OS2Fleetoptimiser

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the **OS2Fleetoptimiser** organization!

This organization is dedicated to the development and optimization of the OS2Fleetoptimiser project. To ensure a uniform and effective setup of our repositories, in the initial phase we use a [dedicated Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OS2fleetoptimiser/project-setup/issues) to manage and track all tasks related to the organizational setup and preparation for the upcoming code repositories.

## Getting Started

To get involved, [visit our Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OS2fleetoptimiser/project-setup/issues) and check out the open issues. Feel free to contribute by opening new issues or participating in existing discussions.

## Contact
